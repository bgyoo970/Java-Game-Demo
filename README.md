# Java-Game-Demo

Collision, movement, sprint, fire actions work as expected. 

Controls:

Movement
up: w
left: a
down: s
right: d

Sprint
Directions in conjunction with holding down the SHIFT key.

Shoot Fireball
Left mouse button in the direction to fire.

###### Note
Still need to implement NPCs, enemies, and AI. Character sprites were obtained by a free provider online. TileSprites and projectile sprites were created with the use of Paint.NET. Water sprites have no interaction as of yet; they act as any other walkable tilesprite. 

To play the demo, run Game.java. IDE used for this project was Eclipse.
